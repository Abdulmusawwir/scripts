# Scripts for Level.io
Welcome to the community script repository for [Level.io](https://level.io).  These scripts are intended to help IT Admins improve their automation efforts in support IT infrastructre and endpoints.  These are provided for Level clients, however these scripts will work with any automation system, or on a single device.

This repo is provided as a courtesy for Level clients, however scripts should not be run in a production environment without first testing!  Some scripts may include 3rd-party binaries for installers.  We vet the binaries, however we would reccomend you download binaries directly from the source.  Trust but verify comes to mind here.

# Rules
We welcome community input and contributions.  If you have scripts that you'd like to share (or work on together), feel free to contribute.

Do not include passwords, keys, secrets, certs, etc.  Nothing sensitive should ever be included in this public repository.  Also scrub all scripts of identifying information including client information, IPs, hostnames, FQDNs, etc.

At this time Level supports PowerShell, Bash, and Zsh, so all scripts should fall into one of those 3 scripting languages.

# Conventions
<ul>
<li>  <b>Naming</b> - This is a work in progress.  We're open to discussion here as our library expands.</li>
<li>  <b>Header comment block</b> - Also a work in progress, however as we prepare Level to be able to reference these scripts directly, there will be future guidance here.</li>
</ul>

# Credit
Even though we have created many of the scripts from scratch, some scripts have been copied from other public repos.  We will give credit to the creators in the header comments.  Please let us know if we've missed giving credit where it's due.
